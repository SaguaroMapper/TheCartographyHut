# The Cartographer’s Hut — Non-Goals

This document defines what The Cartographer’s Hut is **not trying to be**.
Anything listed here must not be implemented in the MVP, even if it seems useful or easy.

These non-goals exist to preserve simplicity, speed, and creative freedom.

---

## 1. Not a GIS Tool

The Cartographer’s Hut is **not**:
- A geographic information system
- A spatial analysis platform
- A tool for precise measurement or geodesy

Explicitly excluded:
- Coordinate editing
- Projections selection
- Distance/area calculations
- Attribute tables
- Shapefile editing workflows

Geographic correctness beyond visual boundaries is not a goal.

---

## 2. Not a Data Authority

The Hut does **not** claim factual accuracy.

Explicitly excluded:
- Automatic GDP, population, speed limit, or similar data
- Verified datasets
- Fact checking or validation
- “Official” or “authoritative” labels

Maps represent the **creator’s perspective**, opinions, or storytelling intent.

---

## 3. Not a Full Video Editor

While the Hut has a timeline, it is **not** trying to replace:
- Premiere Pro
- After Effects
- DaVinci Resolve
- CapCut

Explicitly excluded:
- Advanced compositing
- Complex keyframe graphs
- Color grading
- Multi-track audio mixing
- Transitions libraries

The Hut focuses on **map-centric animation**, nothing more.

## 4. Not a Design System or Template Marketplace

Explicitly excluded:
- Asset stores
- Paid templates
- Community template sharing (for MVP)
- Brand kits
- Font marketplaces

Creators bring their own assets if needed.

---

## 5. Not an AI-Driven Editor (for MVP)

Explicitly excluded:
- “Make this map for me”
- Automatic animation generation
- Prompt-based editing
- AI fact inference

AI assistance may exist in future versions, but the MVP must function fully without AI.

---

## 6. Not a Social Platform

Explicitly excluded:
- User accounts
- Profiles
- Likes, comments, follows
- Public galleries
- Sharing or publishing features

The Hut is a **creation tool**, not a network.

---

## 7. Not Mobile-First

Explicitly excluded:
- Touch-optimized editing
- Mobile UI layouts
- App-store deployment

Desktop browser experience is the priority.

---

## 8. Not a Fantasy World Builder (Yet)

Explicitly excluded from MVP:
- Procedural continents
- Biomes, climates, tectonics
- Lore systems
- Custom planets or galaxies

Fantasy and universe creation are future expansions, not part of v1.

---

## 9. Not a Long-Term Storage Platform

Explicitly excluded:
- Cloud save systems
- Account-based project syncing
- Collaboration
- Version history across sessions

Projects may exist only locally or in-session for MVP.

---

## 10. Design Philosophy Enforcement

If a feature:
- Adds cognitive load
- Requires a tutorial
- Makes the interface feel technical
- Encourages “correctness” over clarity

It should not be included in MVP.

Simplicity is not a missing feature.
It is the feature.
